## Logic Analysis

- ['main.py', 'Initialize Flask application, register blueprints, handle routing']
- ['models.py', 'Define User and Bot classes, handle database interactions']
- ['forms.py', 'Define form classes for user input']
- ['views.py', 'Handle HTTP requests and responses, interact with models and forms']
- ['services/grid_bot_service.py', 'Implement grid bot logic, interact with exchanges']
- ['tests/test_grid_bot_service.py', 'Test grid bot service functionality']

## Task list

- main.py
- models.py
- forms.py
- views.py
- services/grid_bot_service.py
- tests/test_grid_bot_service.py

## Shared Knowledge


        'main.py' is the main entry point of the application. It initializes the Flask application and registers the blueprints.
        'models.py' contains the data models for User and Bot, and handles all database interactions.
        'forms.py' defines the form classes for user input.
        'views.py' handles HTTP requests and responses. It interacts with the models and forms to process user input and generate responses.
        'services/grid_bot_service.py' implements the grid bot logic. It interacts with the exchanges to perform trading operations.
        'tests/test_grid_bot_service.py' contains tests for the grid bot service functionality.
