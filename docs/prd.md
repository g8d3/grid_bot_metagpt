## Original Requirements

Create a web application that allows users to create grid bots in Kucoin and Gate using CCXT. The grid will be arithmetic below the current price and geometric above. Each user, after sign in, gets to a page where the user sees a table which shows each exchange and symbol with the parameters that allow the user to make sure the bot is running correctly. The table should be paginated, filterable, for example, to see all bots for one exchange, or for several. Each column should be filterable.

## Product Goals

- Create a user-friendly web application for managing grid bots
- Provide a clear and concise table view of bot parameters and status
- Ensure the application is scalable and supports multiple exchanges

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to create and manage grid bots for different exchanges
- As a user, I want to view all my bots in a paginated, filterable table
- As a user, I want to filter the table by exchange or multiple exchanges
- As a user, I want to ensure my bot is running correctly by viewing its parameters and status

## Competitive Analysis

- 3Commas: Offers a wide range of bot types including grid bots, but lacks a dedicated table view for bot status
- Cryptohopper: Provides extensive bot management features, but lacks support for Kucoin and Gate
- TradeSanta: Supports a variety of exchanges and bot types, but lacks a filterable table view
- Pionex: Offers grid bot functionality and supports multiple exchanges, but lacks a user-friendly interface
- Bitsgap: Provides a comprehensive bot management platform, but lacks support for arithmetic and geometric grids

## Requirement Analysis

The product requires a user-friendly interface for creating and managing grid bots on Kucoin and Gate exchanges. It should provide a filterable, paginated table view for bot status and parameters. The grid should be arithmetic below the current price and geometric above.

## Requirement Pool

- ['P0', 'Create a web application interface for managing grid bots']
- ['P0', 'Implement a filterable, paginated table view for bot status and parameters']
- ['P1', 'Support for Kucoin and Gate exchanges']
- ['P1', 'Implement arithmetic and geometric grid functionality']
- ['P2', 'Implement user authentication and profile management']

## UI Design draft

The UI should be clean and intuitive, with a navigation bar for accessing different features. The main page should display a table view of all bots, with filter options for exchanges. Each row in the table represents a bot, with columns for exchange, symbol, and parameters. There should also be a form for creating new bots, with fields for selecting the exchange, setting the grid parameters, and starting the bot.

## Anything UNCLEAR

The specific parameters for the grid bot are not specified. Further clarification is needed on the arithmetic and geometric grid functionality.
