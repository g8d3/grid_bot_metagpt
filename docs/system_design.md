## Implementation approach

We will use Flask as our web framework due to its simplicity and flexibility. For the front-end, we will use Bootstrap to create a responsive and user-friendly interface. SQLAlchemy will be used for database interactions, while Flask-Login will handle user authentication. We will use CCXT library to interact with Kucoin and Gate exchanges. The grid bot logic will be implemented as a separate service that interacts with the database and the exchanges. For testing, we will use pytest and for deployment, Docker can be used to ensure consistency across different environments.

## Data structures and interface definitions

        class User{
            +int id
            +str username
            +str password_hash
            +list[Bot] bots
            +__init__(username: str, password: str)
            +check_password(password: str): bool
        }
        class Bot{
            +int id
            +str exchange
            +str symbol
            +float lower_price
            +float upper_price
            +int grid_levels
            +User user
            +__init__(exchange: str, symbol: str, lower_price: float, upper_price: float, grid_levels: int, user: User)
        }
        User "1" -- "*" Bot: has
    

## Program call flow


    sequenceDiagram
        participant U as User
        participant F as Flask
        participant B as Bot
        participant G as GridBotService
        U->>F: Request to create bot
        F->>U: Show bot creation form
        U->>F: Submit form with bot parameters
        F->>B: Create new bot instance
        B->>G: Start bot
        G->>B: Update bot status
        F->>U: Show updated bot status
    

## Anything UNCLEAR

The requirement is clear to me.
